TyP000n – (Like “Typhoon”) is a high-octane storm against typosquatting attacks! This tool unleashes a torrent of advanced, asynchronous fuzzing techniques—flipping bits, swapping vowels, and even substituting Cyrillic lookalikes—to generate thousands of domain variants. With lightning-fast DNS, WHOIS, and SSL checks, plus a composite risk score powered by fuzzy hashing, TyP000n slices through the noise to pinpoint malicious impersonators. It’s not just a tool—it’s a relentless tempest that protects your brand from the chaos of typo-based cyber threats.
